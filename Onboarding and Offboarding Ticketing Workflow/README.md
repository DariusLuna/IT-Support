# Overview
This project demonstrates a sample onboarding and offboarding ticket workflow within an organizational IT environment. It focuses on handling service tickets, Active Directory user management, and remote support tasks.

The setup and configuration of the underlying infrastructure—such as the ticketing system, tickets, NAT, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), virtual machines, organizational units (OUs), and security groups—are assumed to be preconfigured and are not covered in this project. The primary objective is to showcase ticket handling, Active Directory operations, and remote support processes in a realistic workflow scenario.
